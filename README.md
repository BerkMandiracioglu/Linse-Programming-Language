# Linse-Programming-Language
Linse is a propositional logic programming language. This project is about the design of a new language for propositional calculus. Linse similar to imperative languages with the main difference of only working with variables and expressions of logical type. In the process of the design of this language first I have designed the Context-free Grammar of Linse in BNF. Then, I have did the lexical analyses that is necessary to generate the tokens of the language. Then I have implemented a Parser using yacc that used tokens generated from lexical analysis as input.
